Shot Division List: 
Music Video

1. Opening shot – Mid shot of me asleep in bed. Calm and still, lighting’s soft, sets the mood.

2. Cut to body shot – I’m still sleeping, slight shift in position. Camera holds.

3. Dream transition – No obvious cut, but suddenly I’m in a car. Camera’s inside, side profile of me driving. Dream vibe kicks in.

4. Side interior shot – I pick up my friend. Camera stays inside the car, smooth shot.

5. Exterior car shot – Camera now outside, shows the car pulling up as my friend gets in the passenger seat.

6. Back to interior – Both of us inside the car, we start driving. Smoke fills the air from the J (fake grass).

7. Outside tracking shot – Shows the car driving through streets. Adds motion and energy.

8. Drift shot – Car drifts across the road, dramatic and sudden. Camera captures it clean from outside.

9. Frontal shot – Car comes to a slow stop directly in front of the camera. Headlights on, bright and intense.

10. Top-down shot – Drone-style angle from above the car. Gives that cinematic, surreal feel.
11. Trunk scene – Camera positioned so we see both of us laughing as we look into the open trunk. Implication of a body inside.

12. First-person POV – New section. From my perspective, we kidnap a friend. Camera shaky and close, feels chaotic.

13. Dream ends – Cuts back to me in bed, similar to the opening shot. The energy drops back down.

14. Wake up mid shot – I open my eyes slowly, confused expression. Still no close-ups.

15. Final shot – I open the curtains. Full body or mid shot from behind. Natural light pours in. Feels like a return to reality.
