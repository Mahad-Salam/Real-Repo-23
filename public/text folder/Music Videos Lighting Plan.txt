Music Videos Lighting Plan 
 1. Real World – Bedroom
Natural lighting only was used here, with no artificial lights interfering. The intention was to create a sense of realism and calm before the dream begins.
When I’m asleep, the room is dim—lit just enough to show my body on the bed. It creates a quiet, almost lifeless feeling, like time has slowed down.
The use of soft shadows across the bed adds a layer of emptiness, setting the emotional tone of numbness and disconnection.
At the end, when I wake up and open the curtains, there’s a distinct shift. The room fills with natural sunlight—bright and overexposed, flooding the space. It contrasts the darkness of the dream and symbolizes snapping back to reality.
This final white/golden glow acts like a visual “reset,” reminding the audience that what they just saw was all inside my head.
2. Dream Sequence – Car Interior

Inside the car, the lighting is dark and low, mostly relying on streetlights passing by and the soft glow of the dashboard. It creates a sense of intimacy and mystery, like we’re in a different world.
We used warm colours like orange and red to build that hazy, surreal vibe—especially when we light the joint. The lighter’s flame gives off brief, flickering orange tones that momentarily light our faces.
These warm hues are important because they give a feeling of comfort, but also danger—fitting the dream’s confusing and unpredictable nature.
There are occasional white flashes during this sequence, especially during the kidnapping memory. These are quick, disorienting bursts—like flashbacks breaking through the dream. They signal my subconscious trying to remind me what really happened.
These flashes are a direct visual callback to the trauma of the kidnapping, even if my character doesn’t react to them outwardly.
3. Dream Sequence – Car Exterior + Driving Scenes

When the camera moves outside the car, things get more dramatic. Headlights become a key source of light, especially when the car comes to a stop directly in front of the camera.
This creates a high-contrast moment—intense white light hitting the lens, while everything else stays in shadow. It feels aggressive and dreamlike, adding to the tension.
Drifting scenes are lit by ambient light from the environment—again mostly from streetlights and whatever urban setting we’re in. This gives it that raw, late-night vibe.
During certain moments, the lighting shifts into a deep red hue, especially during darker dream moments like the trunk scene. Red is used here to represent violence, danger, and psychological pressure.
There’s also some black and red contrast used in the trunk reveal scene, where everything around us is in shadow except our faces and the open trunk. This is where the lighting helps build suspense without showing everything explicitly.
4. Dream Sequence – Top-Down / Drone Shot

From above, lighting stays minimal. We relied on existing light sources—either ambient streetlights or the glow from the car itself.
This makes it feel more detached and dreamlike, as if we’re watching the scene from another plane or out-of-body perspective.
It emphasizes how surreal the dream is and visually distances the viewer from what’s happening below.
5. Lighting as a Narrative Tool

Colour was intentional throughout:
Red – tension, danger, emotional pressure
Orange – warmth, confusion, distortion
Black – emptiness, isolation
White flashes – memory, trauma, mental intrusion
Natural light at the end – clarity, reality, but also emotional emptiness
The lighting supports the narrative flow: from calm (real life), to chaotic (dream), to abrupt clarity (waking up).
Just like the music builds and drops, the lighting reflects those shifts—especially during the transition into and out of the dream.
