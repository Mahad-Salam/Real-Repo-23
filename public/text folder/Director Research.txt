Director Research:
While planning my music video, I made sure to conduct extensive director research to understand how leading music video directors bring abstract ideas to life—especially within the psychedelic trap genre that inspired my piece. The aim was to study the storytelling techniques, visual languages, and emotional expressions top directors use, so I could apply similar principles in a way that felt authentic to my vision.

One of the first directors I focused on was Dave Meyers. He is known for creating some of the most surreal, high-concept music videos for artists like Travis Scott (Stop Trying to Be God), Kendrick Lamar (HUMBLE.), and Billie Eilish (Bad Guy). Meyers’ work taught me how important symbolism and visual metaphors are. He often layers multiple meanings into single scenes, using exaggerated environments, dream-like sequences, and camera tricks to take the audience on a psychological journey. His videos rarely have a straightforward narrative—instead, they operate on a subconscious, emotional level, which is exactly what I wanted to achieve with my own video.

I also studied Nabil Elderkin, who directed Travis Scott’s Antidote and several videos for Frank Ocean and Kanye West. Nabil’s style is more raw and atmospheric. He often uses natural lighting, slower pacing, and intimate close-ups to create a feeling of realness even within surreal settings. From Nabil, I learned the power of stillness—how sometimes slowing the moment down, focusing on an expression or a small gesture, can say more than a busy sequence of shots.

Travis Scott himself was also an influence. He has a hand in the creative direction of many of his videos, and his visual world is very distinctive: a blend of dystopian environments, spiritual symbolism, and drug-induced hallucinations. Studying how Travis collaborates with directors gave me insight into how much an artist's personal vision shapes the final product. It made me more confident in sticking to the emotional, slightly chaotic tone I wanted.

Key Techniques I Noted from Director Research:

Use of vibrant but dark color palettes to reflect internal states.
Fast cuts and seamless transitions to match the fluctuating energy of the music.
Surreal imagery that blends the real and the imagined (e.g., floating scenes, bending environments).
Emphasis on emotional intensity over clear, linear storytelling.
Lighting as a symbolic tool—contrasting shadows, colored fogs, or backlit silhouettes to reflect emotional highs and lows.
By conducting director research, I built a toolkit of creative techniques that allowed me to shape my music video beyond simple visuals. I learned how to use camera movement, editing rhythm, mise-en-scène, and color grading to trigger deeper emotional responses from the audience. It wasn’t just about copying styles—it was about understanding the emotional architecture behind successful videos and using that knowledge to craft my own personal, meaningful piece.
