1. How do your products represent social groups or issues?
My music video mainly represents youth culture and the issues of escapism and how people my age sometimes deal with heavy emotions. I showed a lot of themes like loneliness, rebellion, and trying to escape reality through dreaming or reckless behavior. When you see me waking up shirtless in bed and falling into a dream where I’m speeding around, smoking, and kidnapping someone, it shows the extreme sides of what’s going on inside someone’s mind. It’s not about real violence, it’s more about showing how messed up and chaotic things feel when you’re trapped inside your own head. I didn’t show it in a cheesy or fake way either, it felt real because that’s what a lot of us actually go through, especially when you’re trying to look like you’re fine on the outside but you’re not.

The dream parts show how people try to mentally escape from their problems instead of facing them. The character I played represents a lot of young people who feel disconnected and frustrated. You can tell from the body language, the way I drive, the smoking, even the casual way we laugh at something dark like the body in the trunk. It’s that numbness to stuff that should be serious, which I think is a real issue in youth culture today. So overall, the video shines a light on how young people sometimes mask pain with fake freedom, reckless behavior, or even violence inside their imaginations.

2. How do the elements of your production work together to create a sense of branding?
For my branding, I really focused on the vibe and the colors, just like in the Travis Scott "Highest in the Room" era. I used a lot of dark lighting, with black, red, orange, and sometimes flashes of white. Those flashes showed memories or flashes of the kidnapping scene in the dream. The black and red colors gave it that dangerous, dreamlike vibe, like things could snap at any moment.

My digipak also matches all of that. The cover shows dark smoke and fire-type colors behind me, and the font on “Highest In The Room” is serious and bold, not playful or colorful. It keeps the tone consistent. I chose those colors because they match the mood of the video and the type of music. Everything looks connected.

On the Instagram page we created for the music video, I kept using the same colors, the same type of serious captions, and posts that kept that dream vs reality theme. I posted teaser clips from the video that showed the dream scenes or the driving scenes. I kept it mysterious too, so it matched the feeling of the video. Even the fonts and filters I used on posts were dark and smokey looking to match the visual branding.

Everything was made to remind the audience of the same emotions: isolation, rebellion, being stuck in your head. Nothing felt random, it was all chosen to feel part of one big mood.

3. How do your products engage with the audience?
I focused a lot on building mystery and making people curious through the Instagram page. I posted short teasers before the full video dropped, showing things like the speeding car, the dream sequence, and even a glimpse of the body in the trunk, but without giving too much away. I used captions that made it sound like something bigger was happening, like "Is it a dream or is it real?" and stuff like that. That way, people would start guessing and getting hyped up before seeing the whole thing.

After I dropped the full video on Instagram, I kept posting still shots and behind-the-scenes moments to keep people talking about it. Like bloopers of the drifting scene and how we faked the smoke and the lighter. I also posted short clips of the kidnapping scene from the first-person view, which got a lot of comments because people didn’t expect that switch of perspective.

The whole idea was to make it not just a music video, but almost like an experience or a story people could get involved in. I encouraged comments by asking stuff like "What do you think really happened at the end?" to get people sharing theories. I even replied to comments in a casual way to keep it feeling real and not like some corporate promo.

Basically, I made the Instagram page feel like a natural extension of the video. I made sure the audience didn’t just watch it once and forget it, but kept thinking about it and talking about it after.

4. How did your research inform your products and the way they use or challenge conventions?
When I was researching before making the video, I spent a lot of time looking at Travis Scott’s “Highest in the Room” video and similar dream-like, surreal videos. I noticed how they used low lighting, strong colors, slow movements, and dream logic where not everything had to make sense in a normal way. I also looked at other dark-themed music videos where they didn’t show things in a super clear, step-by-step way but more through feelings and moods.

That influenced me a lot. I didn’t want my video to be super literal or to explain every little thing. I wanted the audience to feel it instead of just understand it logically. That’s why the kidnapping scene is shown through flashes and a first-person view instead of showing the whole thing step-by-step. That’s why you don’t really know 100% if the body in the trunk is real or just part of the dream. I kept things mysterious because that’s what I saw working in the videos I studied.

I also challenged some conventions because most normal music videos for young rappers are super focused on showing off money, cars, girls, and flexing. I didn’t want that. I wanted to show a darker side — where even the car and the smoking have a deeper meaning about trying to escape reality, not just flexing for the camera.

By keeping it emotional and dreamlike instead of materialistic and flashy, I feel like I made something more personal and true to my inspiration. And honestly, after looking at the final result and seeing how the video, the digipak, and the Instagram all matched and worked together, I think I achieved what I planned.
