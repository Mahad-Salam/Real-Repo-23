Bloopers :
As much as I wanted everything to go smoothly, shooting this video came with its fair share of bloopers—some funny, some frustrating, but all part of the process. It wasn’t a massive team shoot, so things went wrong, and we just had to roll with it.

1. Lighter Not Working
We had multiple takes where the lighter just refused to work. The joint was fake, obviously, but the moment still had to look real. We’d get into the perfect position, music playing, camera rolling—and then nothing. Either it wouldn’t spark or we’d burn through it before the take even finished. Eventually had to time it perfectly and pray it looked good on camera.

2. Breaking Character During the Trunk Scene
The scene where me and my friend laugh at the body in the trunk was nearly impossible to shoot without us genuinely cracking up. It was meant to be eerie and uncomfortable—but having a “body” prop in the trunk just looked so ridiculous out of context. We kept laughing during takes. Took a while to actually get one where we looked disturbed instead of just goofy.

3. POV Kidnapping Scene – Direction Confusion
Because the kidnapping flashback was filmed in first-person, we kept getting confused on blocking—who moves where, who holds what, etc. It’s harder than it looks to act and direct a scene where the camera is basically the character’s eyes. Took a few takes to get the right amount of motion without it being shaky or chaotic.

4. Car Camera Shifts
Filming inside the car brought its own headaches. The camera would slide slightly between takes or not frame us right, especially when we were driving around. There were a few moments where one of us would be mid-sentence or lighting up and the camera was accidentally pointed at the dashboard.

5. Curtain Timing
For the final shot, opening the curtains needed to sync with the lighting perfectly. There was this one time where the sunlight came in too weak or too harsh, depending on the time of day. We kept trying to hit that perfect golden glow moment—ended up reshooting that part at least three times.

Overall, even though the bloopers were annoying in the moment, they helped shape the final video. Some mistakes even led to better decisions later. It wasn’t about perfection—it was about capturing a feeling, and sometimes the mess-ups added to that.
