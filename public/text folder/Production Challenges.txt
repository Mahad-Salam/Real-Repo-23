Production – Challenges Faced

When it came to actually producing the music video, there were definitely a few challenges that came up along the way, both expected and unexpected.

One of the main challenges was coordinating the dream sequences. Because a lot of my concept relied on the audience being able to tell the difference between dream and reality without making it too obvious, it was tricky to get the right vibe through the camera work and acting. Some of the first takes didn’t feel “dreamy” enough, so I had to reshoot a few moments with slower movements, more dramatic lighting, and slightly exaggerated expressions to get the right surreal feeling across.

Another big challenge was shooting inside the car. Filming from inside a moving vehicle was a lot harder than I expected. Getting steady shots while the car was driving, especially from the passenger seat side angle, took multiple tries. The bumps in the road, the lighting constantly changing outside, and the cramped space made it tough to keep the framing consistent. We didn’t have professional rigging equipment either, so it was literally balancing the camera carefully and hoping for smooth driving.

Lighting was another issue, especially because I wanted to create that smoky red/orange dream look. We didn’t have access to proper red light panels, so I had to improvise using coloured gels, car lights, and editing techniques later on to bring out the hues. It would’ve been easier with professional lighting gear, but I learned a lot from trying to fake that atmosphere with what I had.

Time management also became a challenge because I was relying on friends for acting and help behind the scenes. People were sometimes late, or weather conditions would suddenly change, meaning outdoor shots had to be pushed back. There were a few days where we lost good daylight, and that affected how much natural sunlight I could use for some key shots (especially the final scene with opening the curtains).

Finally, working with props like the fake joint and showing the body in the trunk added its own level of difficulty. We had to be careful about how realistic things looked without making it too over the top or inappropriate for the project requirements.

Despite these challenges, every issue actually forced me to think more creatively and adapt on the spot, which I think made the final video feel even more authentic and raw.

How I Overcame Challenges

Even though a lot of issues came up during production, I made sure to stay flexible and think creatively rather than getting stuck. For the dream sequences, I adjusted the acting style and camera movement on the spot to create a more surreal, floaty feeling without needing crazy effects. When the inside-the-car shots were unstable, I found better road routes with smoother ground and tried handheld techniques that felt more natural for the dream vibe anyway.

For the lighting, I used a mix of car headlights, coloured filters, and heavy editing in post-production to bring out the red and orange hues that weren’t strong enough in raw footage. Instead of worrying about missing daylight for some scenes, I reshuffled the shoot schedule and filmed indoor dream scenes first while waiting for better outdoor conditions.

When it came to managing friends who helped act and film, I stayed patient and made sure everyone clearly knew what scenes we had to get done first, so even if we lost time, we still captured the important shots. Every challenge made me better at improvising and problem-solving, which massively improved the overall project.
