Questionnaire:
To ensure my music video would resonate with an audience and align with their expectations while still maintaining my artistic vision, I created a questionnaire as part of my primary research. This was crucial in shaping decisions around the style, themes, and techniques I wanted to include in the final product.

The questionnaire was designed to gather both quantitative and qualitative feedback. I distributed it digitally to a mix of people—some who were into trap/psychedelic rap, others who weren’t regular listeners, to get a balanced perspective. My main aim was to understand what the audience looks for in a music video, what emotions they want to feel, and how they engage with the visuals tied to this genre.

Some of the key questions included:

What do you expect from a Travis Scott-style music video?
Do visuals affect how deeply you connect with a song?
Which elements stand out most in a trap/psychedelic rap music video? (e.g., color, editing, performance, storyline, symbolism)
Would you rather see a narrative or abstract visuals?
How important is emotional connection or vulnerability in a music video?
What kind of lighting, colors, and atmosphere do you associate with this genre?
Results and Analysis:

The responses showed a clear trend—most participants preferred abstract, symbolic visuals over linear narratives. They were drawn to mood, atmosphere, and emotional intensity. Lighting, color grading, and surreal editing styles were consistently ranked as the most powerful tools in trap videos. This feedback validated my instinct to go heavy on symbolism and visual emotion rather than focusing on a traditional storyline.

Some people mentioned how the feeling of being lost, floating, or detached in Travis Scott’s videos made them feel immersed—and that’s exactly the kind of immersive, introspective experience I wanted to create. Others emphasized the importance of authenticity—that even if the video was stylized, it needed to come from a real place emotionally. That influenced how I performed and structured scenes, choosing to reflect isolation, self-reflection, and spiritual conflict in a symbolic way.

One interesting piece of feedback was the impact of pacing—people said they noticed when editing didn't match the tempo or mood of the track. So I paid extra attention to syncing my visuals tightly with the music's highs and lows. The feedback also helped me choose darker tones, smoke effects, and a slower, more hypnotic pace to reflect the psychological state described in the song.

Conclusion:

The questionnaire gave me a clearer understanding of audience expectations while still allowing me the freedom to experiment. It acted as a bridge between my personal vision and what viewers subconsciously seek in music videos within this genre. It also taught me the value of emotional anticipation—not just what people say they want, but what they feel when they experience visuals that match sound. This feedback loop made my final product more intentional, more connected, and more impactful.
