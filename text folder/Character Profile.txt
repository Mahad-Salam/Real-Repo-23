Character Profile –
Name: Maximus 
Role: Main character / protagonist
Screen Time: Appears throughout the entire video
Personality Traits: Mysterious, emotionally distant, and controlled. I stay calm even when things get wild in the dream, like the kidnapping or the body in the trunk. The performance is subtle on purpose—there’s more going on internally than what’s shown on the outside.

Character Purpose:
My character represents that blurred line between real life and subconscious thought. The whole video revolves around me drifting into a dream and experiencing a chaotic version of reality—driving around, smoking, picking up a friend, and even laughing at something dark like a body in the trunk. It’s meant to show how the mind processes suppressed emotions or thoughts. Then I wake up—still numb—and open the curtains, but nothing feels resolved. That’s the point.

Style & Costume:
In the dream: I wear a black button-down shirt with black dress pants—clean, sharp, slightly formal, but still simple. It gives the dream a surreal edge, like I’m dressed too neatly for how messy the events get.
In real life: I’m shirtless when asleep, lying in bed. The contrast between that and the dream version of me shows how different our inner world can be from our real one.

Performance Style:
Everything’s held back. No over-acting, no big expressions. I barely react—even when something shocking happens. It’s all about creating that cold, distant energy, kind of like Travis Scott in Highest in the Room. That silence and stillness builds tension way more than shouting or moving around ever could.
