Music Video Referencing:
 During the early stages of planning my music video, I spent a significant amount of time referencing existing music videos that aligned with the mood, style, and emotional atmosphere I wanted to capture. This process was essential in shaping my creative vision and understanding the technical and symbolic elements that elevate a music video from simple visuals to a cinematic experience.

The primary reference was Travis Scott’s Highest in the Room. This video served as the core inspiration—not only because I used the same track—but because of how it fused surrealism with emotional storytelling. I was drawn to the way it used symbolism, transitions, and visual effects to create a psychedelic journey rather than a literal narrative. It showed me how a music video could represent someone's inner world—the chaos, the confusion, the highs and lows—all without using dialogue or conventional storytelling.

From that starting point, I also referenced other videos like:

Don Toliver – “After Party”: This helped me understand how to use lighting and environment to create contrast between reality and illusion. It also gave me ideas for color grading and setting mood through minimal action.
The Weeknd – “Call Out My Name”: I studied how the use of slow motion and dramatic staging added intensity and emotional weight, even in relatively simple shots.
Kendrick Lamar – “HUMBLE.”: This was helpful for camera movement and framing—showing how even abrupt cuts and experimental visuals can work powerfully when tied to the music’s rhythm and meaning.
Kanye West – “Ghost Town (Live)”: The raw emotional energy and atmospheric lighting in that performance pushed me to think more deeply about how to convey vulnerability visually.
While referencing, I didn’t just look at visuals—I also paid attention to editing rhythm, pacing, narrative structure (or intentional lack of it), and how visuals interacted with the beats and lyrics. I kept a mood board and shot reference list, breaking down scenes that stood out to me and noting techniques I wanted to replicate or reimagine in my own way.

I was careful not to copy anything directly. Instead, I used these references as a source of inspiration—a launchpad to develop my own style. I learned how professional music videos manage to be abstract but still emotionally grounded, and how small details like color temperature, camera tilt, or smoke layering can change the entire vibe of a scene.

In the end, referencing became more than research—it became a way to sharpen my eye for visual storytelling. It gave me a deeper understanding of how to bridge sound and image in a meaningful way, and it allowed me to walk the line between influence and originality with confidence.
