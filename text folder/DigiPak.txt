Digipak Section

1. Analysis

The digipak design uses a heavy mix of smoky textures, strong contrasting colours, and emotional portraits to match the mood of the track and the music video. The front cover shows a low-lit image of the artist (me) looking down, set against a dark red and purple smoky background. This instantly builds a dark, introspective vibe.

The title “Highest in the Room” sits alone on the second panel, bold and centered, surrounded by red smoke. The inside design features a CD covered in swirling fire and smoke textures, tying visually back to the front cover, and a final shot of the artist floating in a deep blue smoky background, symbolizing detachment or an out-of-body dream state.

Throughout the digipak, there’s a clear focus on isolation, mental escape, and emotional weight, which links perfectly to the storyline of my music video where dreams, reality, and mental states blur into each other.

2. Reasoning

Every element in the digipak was chosen to match the story and emotional tone of my project.
Here’s why I made the decisions I did:

Colours:
Red, orange, and smoky textures were used to represent chaos, passion, and mental overload (which show up during the dream sequences of the video). The shift to blue hints at calmness but also loneliness, mirroring the waking up scene where reality feels empty.
Imagery:
The choice to have a downcast portrait on the cover makes it feel personal and vulnerable. Showing myself floating on the inside panel links directly to the surreal, dreamlike feel of the music video—suggesting escapism or feeling disconnected from reality.
Typography:
The strong serif font gives the title a serious, heavy feel, like it’s almost branded into the smoke. It keeps the focus on the emotional weight rather than being too playful or casual.
Consistency:
I made sure the visual language (smoke, deep shadows, colour scheme) stayed consistent across the whole digipak so that the viewer always feels like they are inside the same mental world the video builds.
The main goal was to make the digipak feel like an extension of the video’s story, not just some random album art.

3. Evaluation

Overall, I think the digipak successfully captures the dark, emotional, and surreal atmosphere that runs through my music video. The colour palette and imagery help tell the story visually, even before someone listens to the track or watches the video.

One of the strengths of the digipak is its emotional consistency. Every part—from the smoky effects to the expressions and floating imagery—feels connected to the central theme of mental isolation and dreamlike detachment. It feels like you are stepping into the world of the character straight away.

If I had more time or more resources, I might have pushed the visuals even further—for example, adding more subtle symbolism hidden in the smoke or including a few handwritten lyrics on the inside to make it even more personal. But honestly, I’m happy with how clean, bold, and emotional the final digipak turned out. It does its job of setting the tone for the audience before they even press play.
