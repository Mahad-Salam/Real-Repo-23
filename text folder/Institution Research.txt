Institution Research
As part of the planning phase, I conducted in-depth institution research to understand how music videos like mine are produced, distributed, and promoted by major labels and media institutions. This helped me place my project within a broader industry context and also gave me insight into how institutions influence creative decisions, artist branding, and audience reach.

I began by studying record labels that produce artists similar to Travis Scott—mainly Cactus Jack Records, which is Travis Scott’s own label, operating under Epic Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment. I looked at how these institutions function—not just as distributors of music, but as branding powerhouses. They handle everything from marketing strategies and collaborations to overseeing the tone and aesthetics of music videos. What struck me was the level of control they have over an artist's public image and how consistent branding is maintained across music videos, merchandise, social media, and live performances.

I also looked at platforms that commonly host these music videos, particularly YouTube (Vevo) and Apple Music, because these are not just content platforms—they act as institutions themselves, with algorithms, featured content sections, and curated playlists that can dramatically impact a video's reach. I researched how trending videos work, how thumbnails and titles are optimized, and how engagement (likes, shares, watch time) affects visibility. This helped me think more strategically about how I’d present my own video, especially in terms of pacing, visual hooks, and replay value.

I also explored production companies and directors who frequently work with trap and psychedelic rap artists—names like La Flame Productions (Travis’s team), Dave Meyers, and Nabil Elderkin. These professionals have distinct styles, and I analyzed how their visual techniques became institutional trademarks within the genre—such as Meyers' use of surrealist cinematography or Nabil's raw emotional aesthetics. This helped me understand how institutional backing allows certain visual experiments to reach mainstream platforms while still maintaining artistic integrity.

In addition to this, I reflected on the institutional codes and conventions that are often expected in music videos—brand placement, artist visibility, structured pacing, and clear genre alignment. Understanding these helped me decide how far I wanted to go in aligning with or breaking away from those expectations. Since my video was an independent project, I knew I didn’t need to conform entirely—but being aware of what industry-level videos do helped me elevate the quality and intention behind each creative choice.

Conclusion:

Institutional research taught me that music videos are more than just artistic expression—they are deeply tied to brand identity, commercial viability, and audience psychology. By studying how large institutions shape music video production and promotion, I became more strategic in how I approached my own project. It gave me the mindset of a professional, not just a student, and helped me make decisions with a clearer understanding of how the industry operates on every level—from creation to consumption.
