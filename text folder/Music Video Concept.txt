Music Video Concept
The core concept of my music video is built around the idea of blurring reality and dreams, and how the mind can twist both into something that feels real—even when it’s not. It’s not a straightforward narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Instead, it’s more of a visual experience—one that reflects how it feels to be mentally stuck, drifting, and emotionally distant.

It starts with me in bed, shirtless, in a dimly lit room. I’m asleep, which acts as the entry point into the dream world. From there, the video slips into a surreal space: I’m fully dressed in all black, driving a car, picking up a friend, smoking, and laughing—but it doesn’t feel joyful. There’s an eerie stillness to everything. It’s calm, but slightly off. Then we open the trunk and laugh at the body inside. And somehow, that feels normal in the dream.

In the middle of all that, the dream cuts to a first-person flashback of a kidnapping, with sudden white flashes interrupting the flow—representing memory, trauma, or guilt. These moments aren't fully explained on purpose. They act like mental intrusions, glitching through the illusion.

The dream ends abruptly. I wake up, get out of bed, and open the curtains. Bright natural light floods the room—but I still don’t react. That’s the whole point: even in reality, nothing is really “better.” There’s no big emotional shift. Just numbness.

This concept is heavily inspired by Travis Scott’s "Highest in the Room"—especially that vibe of floating through space, through thoughts, through moods. I wanted to create something that felt like an internal journey, not a literal story. Every scene, every lighting choice, and every bit of movement is meant to reflect what it feels like to be mentally detached—going through the motions, even when something intense is happening.

So yeah—the concept is dream vs. reality. Memory vs. imagination. Calm on the surface, chaos underneath.
