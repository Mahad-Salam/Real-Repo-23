Storyboard
During the pre-production phase, one of the most important tools I developed was the storyboard. This was the visual blueprint for my entire music video, mapping out the sequence of shots, camera movements, and key visual transitions. Creating the storyboard allowed me to organize my ideas clearly before filming began and made sure every shot served a purpose aligned with the emotional and aesthetic goals of the project.

Because my video was heavily inspired by Travis Scott’s surreal and emotionally charged style, my storyboard needed to capture not just actions but also moods, atmospheres, and symbolic transformations. I approached the storyboard not as a rigid frame-by-frame guide, but more like a visual mood flow, where each scene transitioned into the next based on energy, emotion, and symbolic meaning rather than strict linear storytelling.

Storyboard Process:

First, I listened to Highest in the Room multiple times, breaking down the track into sections: intro, build-up, hook, drop, bridge, and outro. This helped me understand where the energy shifted in the song, and where I would need to shift the visual intensity to match.
I then sketched rough frames representing each major scene. I focused heavily on camera angles (close-ups for emotional tension, wide shots for isolation), movements (slow pans, handheld shakiness to create unease), and transitions (match cuts, fading into smoke, glitch effects).
In each frame, I annotated specific visual elements like lighting tone (blue, red, purple hues), background effects (smoke, fog, flickering lights), and performance notes (head movements, expressions of confusion, intensity, or detachment).
Examples from My Storyboard:

Opening Scene: A slow zoom into my character sitting alone in a dark, smoky room, illuminated only by a flickering light, symbolizing internal struggle.
Build-up to the Hook: Quick, disorienting cuts showing the character floating or walking through distorted dream-like environments.
Chorus Scenes: The environment turns chaotic—colors flash, the camera spins, the world blurs—matching the lyrical intensity.
Bridge Section: Time slows. A moment of vulnerability with close-ups on facial expressions, lost in thought or fighting inner demons.
Outro: Fade into darkness with distant echoes of light, symbolizing being lost within oneself, but still holding onto a faint hope.
Why the Storyboard was Essential:

It kept me focused during filming. Since I was both directing and performing, the storyboard made it easier to quickly visualize what needed to happen in each shot without wasting time.
It helped plan lighting setups, camera equipment needs, and editing transitions ahead of time, making production more efficient.
It allowed for creative flexibility—because I knew the emotional beats of the video so well from my storyboard, I could improvise small details during filming while still staying true to the overall vision.
Conclusion: My storyboard wasn’t just a plan—it was the emotional skeleton of the music video. It allowed me to balance artistic spontaneity with professional-level preparation, making sure the final product felt cohesive, powerful, and aligned with the surreal, immersive energy I wanted to create.
