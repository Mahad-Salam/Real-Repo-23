Website Analysis:
As part of the research and planning stage, I also studied the online presence of artists within the same genre, especially focusing on how their official websites are designed and what kind of content they showcase. The goal was to understand how branding, digital presentation, and user experience contribute to the overall identity of an artist or music project.

One of the first websites I analyzed was Travis Scott’s official website (cactusjack.com and related project sites like Astroworld). The design struck me instantly—it was bold, immersive, and completely aligned with the surreal, psychedelic vibe of his music. The color palette was often dark, with pops of neon and glitch effects that reflected the same mood found in his music videos. The transitions between pages were fluid, almost like entering different rooms in a dream. This taught me how important it is to create a consistent visual identity across all platforms.

The homepage often promoted upcoming projects, exclusive merch, and immersive experiences. There was very little text—most of the communication happened visually, either through videos, photos, or interactive elements. This visual-led approach inspired me to consider how much a website can tell a story without needing words. It felt like the site itself was an extension of the music.

I also explored The Weeknd’s and Don Toliver’s websites. The Weeknd’s page was sleek, cinematic, and minimalist—dominated by large-scale visuals, short animations, and a dark theme. Don Toliver’s site focused more on aesthetic presentation of merch and visuals that captured his unique style. Across all these websites, I noticed a shared theme: strong branding. The typography, color schemes, and music integration all aligned perfectly with their video content and overall persona.

This analysis helped me in two major ways. First, it gave me insight into how an artist builds their world visually beyond just videos—how their digital space becomes an extension of their music. Second, it made me think about interactivity and how a website can be more than a static platform; it can be a digital experience that engages fans emotionally.

If I were to create a website for my project, I would draw from these insights—keeping the design immersive and minimal, using key visuals from the music video, and reflecting the emotional tone of the song. It would have subtle animations, layered visuals like smoke or flickering lights, and intuitive navigation that feels like you’re moving through the mental state I’m trying to portray.

This step made me realize that in today’s digital age, an artist’s identity isn’t just in their music—it’s everywhere, from Instagram to merchandise to how their website feels when you first land on it. All of it has to feel connected. Website analysis was key to understanding that bigger picture.
