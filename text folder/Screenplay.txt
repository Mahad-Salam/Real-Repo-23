Screenplay: 
This is the official screenplay breakdown of my music video project based on Highest in the Room by Travis Scott. From the start, I knew I didn’t want to make a typical music video with basic transitions and overused party clips. I wanted something that felt like a trip—a dream that keeps flipping from comfort to chaos, a subconscious expression of modern numbness and thrill-seeking, the dark side of youth culture. The entire video was crafted like a looped dream—where symbolism, speed, violence, and escape blend into a surreal journey that ends with a mental reset.

SCENE 1 – ENTERING THE DREAM (Picking Up the Friend)
[0:00 – 0:15]

The music starts, and the tone is almost too calm. A slow pull-up. I arrive in my car, windows slightly down, sound vibrating low. I stop. My friend’s already waiting, like we both knew this moment would happen. He gets in, we barely speak. But there’s a weight in the air—it’s not just a drive.
It’s the beginning of a descent.

Mood: Quiet tension, subtle foreshadowing.
Symbolism: This isn’t just about picking him up—it’s a symbol for choosing a certain path. From this moment on, reality starts bending.
Notes: We kept the shot natural, nothing overly stylized, because I wanted this to feel like the last moment of ‘normal’ before the spiral.
SCENE 2 – THE DRIFT & THE SMOKE (Speed, Escapism, Intensity)
[0:15 – 0:40]

Suddenly, the visuals flip—we're flying down the road. The tires scream. The car starts to drift, violently. There’s a rush in our faces. Inside the car, we light up. I pull out a rolled joint filled with fake grass, spark the lighter. The flame flickers. A puff. The smoke begins to flood.
This scene isn’t just about speed or drugs—it’s about escaping reality.

Mood: Adrenaline, chaos, psychological high.
Symbolism: The drifting symbolizes emotional instability. We’re in control—but only barely. The joint is fake, but it still gives the illusion of peace. Everything is artificial, everything is spinning.
Notes: I wanted this scene to feel cinematic but personal—like the viewer’s caught in the backseat of our delusion.
SCENE 3 – THE TRUNK / DEAD BODY LAUGHTER
[0:41 – 0:55]

We stop. The smoke clears just enough to bring us back to the present. We step out. Trunk opens. Inside: a dead body.
And we start laughing. Like it’s a prank, like we don’t care.
But that laughter is hollow. It’s covering something deeper.
We’re numb.

Mood: Dark humor, numb thrill.
Symbolism: We’re laughing, but there’s no soul in it. It’s the modern detachment—when you’ve seen too much, or done too much, and nothing feels real anymore.
Notes: We used high-contrast lighting here to make the body feel surreal—almost like a prop in our twisted dream. That’s how disconnected we are.
SCENE 4 – FLASHBACK TO THE KIDNAPPING
[0:56 – 1:10]

Suddenly the screen distorts—the scene rewinds. We get a flashback of the kidnapping. Quick, raw footage of us overpowering the victim and shoving him into the car.
No hesitation. No regret.
The flashback feels more violent because it’s the root of the problem. This is where the body came from. This is where the energy twisted.

Mood: Violent, unfiltered, gritty.
Symbolism: Cause and effect. Even in dreams, you can’t run from what you’ve done. It always comes back.
Notes: We shot this in handheld style to give it urgency, and I kept the lighting low—because even in memory, this scene was hard to face.
SCENE 5 – VIBING OUT: LOST IN THE SOUND
[1:11 – 1:30]

Time slows again. The chaos is over… for now. My friend and I sit back in the car. The music plays louder. Heads nodding. Eyes half-closed.
We’re not talking. We’re just vibing.
But the vibe is hollow. The music fills the silence because we’re avoiding everything else. We’re pretending it’s okay.

Mood: Detached peace.
Symbolism: This scene is the high that comes after destruction. That fake comfort we all chase after chaos—just chilling like nothing happened.
Notes: I used warmer tones here to contrast the darkness before—but that warmth is misleading.
SCENE 6 – THE AWAKENING: OPENING THE CURTAINS
[1:31 – END]

I wake up. Alone.
The dream is over. Or maybe it’s still going.
I walk slowly to the window. Pull back the curtains. The light outside is raw, real. It hits my face like truth. No music. No friend. No smoke. Just silence.

Mood: Reflective, ambiguous.
Symbolism: Opening the curtains is the most powerful moment. It’s the reveal—not just of the dream ending, but of consciousness returning. It’s about seeing clearly again.
Notes: The last shot is a metaphor. After everything—speed, violence, numbness, laughter, false highs—the most shocking thing is silence and light.
Final Thoughts:
This screenplay was built like a spiritual loop. A dream inside a dream. From thrill to death to peace to awareness. Every scene, shot, and prop—from the drifting to the fake joint to the trunk to the curtains—was placed with intention.
The video isn’t just about a story—it’s about a feeling.
It’s what it feels like to be high in the room but low in the soul.
That’s what I tried to show.
