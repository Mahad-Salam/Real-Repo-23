Music Video Treatment
Song Title: Highest in the Room
Artist: Maximus 
Inspiration: Travis Scott – Highest in the Room

Concept Overview:

The video follows one character (me), caught between the real world and a surreal dream world. It starts in a quiet bedroom, showing me asleep and alone, then transitions into a dream that feels smooth at first—driving around, linking up with a friend, smoking—but gradually turns darker and more intense, eventually revealing a body in the trunk and a flashback to a kidnapping. The dream ends abruptly, and I wake up, opening the curtains as sunlight pours in.

The video’s not meant to be literal—it’s a reflection of the mind under pressure. That feeling of escaping reality, only for your own subconscious to throw you into something even worse. It’s about isolation, suppressed emotion, and the blurred line between memory and imagination.

Visual Style & Tone:

The tone is moody, surreal, and a bit unsettling, but not over-the-top dramatic.
Visuals are inspired by Travis Scott’s dreamlike aesthetic—slow movements, shadow-heavy lighting, red/orange hues, white flashes to represent memory glitches.
The pace of the edit follows the song’s rhythm: slow and smooth in the intro, more chaotic and fast during the dream climax, then drops back down in the ending.
The dream sequence has a slightly cinematic, hazy feel, while the real-world scenes are more grounded and still.
The colour palette is limited but powerful—dark tones, black, red, orange, with bright white flashes during flashbacks and a final golden glow when the curtains open.
Narrative Breakdown:

1. Opening (Reality)

Mid shot of me asleep, shirtless, in bed. Calm atmosphere.
Lighting is soft and dim. No music yet—just ambiance.
Sets the tone for the emotional disconnect and isolation.
2. Dream Begins

I suddenly appear in a car, driving.
Pick up a friend. We smoke, we laugh, we vibe.
Lighting is low with red/orange tones. Music kicks in.
There’s a tension building beneath the chill visuals.
3. Dream Intensifies

Outside shots of the car drifting. Headlights flash the screen.
Dream takes a darker turn—we laugh at a body in the trunk.
Camera cuts to a first-person POV of me kidnapping someone with another friend—flashbacks breaking through.
White flashes break the rhythm, symbolizing trauma or memory.
4. Return to Reality

Cut back to me in bed, breathing heavier. Dream’s over.
I slowly get up, walk to the window, and open the curtains.
Natural light fills the room—overexposed, almost heavenly.
No expression on my face. No resolution. Just stillness.
Characters:

Me (Main Character): A calm, emotionally shut-off figure drifting through both reality and dreams.
Friend (Passenger): Symbolic presence in the dream. We don’t talk much, but he represents comfort or distraction.
Kidnapped Person: Only seen from POV or in short flashes. Represents guilt, memory, or some buried emotion I’m avoiding.
Key Themes:

Escapism vs. Reality – The dream feels like freedom at first, but becomes darker than real life.
Suppressed Trauma – The body in the trunk and kidnapping scenes aren’t explained—they just exist, like memories that won’t leave.
Isolation – Whether awake or dreaming, my character is disconnected. There’s no resolution, no change—just cycles.
Mental Distortion – Lighting and visuals reflect a disturbed, dreamlike mind. Nothing is fully grounded in logic.
