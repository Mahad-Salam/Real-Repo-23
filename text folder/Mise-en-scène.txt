Mise-en-scène:
Mise-en-scène played a critical role in constructing the emotional world and tone of my music video. Every visual element—setting, props, lighting, costume, and character positioning—was deliberately chosen to reflect the mental state of the character, and to match the dark, psychedelic energy of Highest in the Room by Travis Scott.

1. Setting & Atmosphere: I filmed in an enclosed, dimly lit room, designed to feel like a psychological trap or inner mental prison. The walls were plain and shadow-heavy to create a sense of claustrophobia, visually amplifying the emotional isolation of the character. I also used outdoor urban textures in certain cuts, but the focus remained on giving the environment an unnatural, almost dreamlike feel—enhancing the feeling of being detached from reality.

2. Props & Symbolism: This is where the mise-en-scène took a very literal and symbolic approach.

The rolled-up fake grass inside a rolling paper, which I lit with a lighter on camera, was meant to mimic drug use without directly showing real substances. It was a visual metaphor for escapism, self-destruction, and the coping mechanisms people use when they're mentally overwhelmed. Lighting it on camera gave a raw, gritty touch—symbolic of spiritual suffocation.
The lighter itself became a recurring prop—a spark in the darkness—representing either fleeting clarity or the temptation of relapse. I made sure to feature it in a moody close-up to give it emotional weight.
The presence of smoke in several scenes, whether implied or created visually, reinforced the idea of a hazy, distorted mental state. It added to the psychedelic and trap-inspired mise-en-scène, heavily influenced by Travis Scott’s visual world.
3. Lighting & Color Scheme: The lighting was one of the most important tools I used.

I kept most scenes low-lit, using shadows to represent the inner darkness of the character. In contrast, I used brief flashes of warm lighting (from the lighter or room bulbs) to create visual tension—moments that felt like glimpses of truth or emotion breaking through the numbness.
The color palette was muted—grays, browns, dim ambers—emphasizing a sense of decay, mental fog, and detachment from the outer world. I wanted the viewer to feel like they were trapped inside the head of someone emotionally spiraling.
4. Costume & Performance:

I wore dark clothing throughout to represent heaviness, depression, and emotional weight. No flashy or clean outfits—just raw, minimal, real. It made me blend into the environment and visually symbolized how the character had no identity left—just emotions and confusion.
My facial expressions and posture were also part of mise-en-scène. I kept my body language slouched, slow, and aimless—like someone who’s high but not peaceful, someone lost in overthinking and regret. That blank stare, the slow lighting of the fake joint—it all added to the emotion I wanted to communicate: numbness with internal chaos.
5. Composition & Camera Framing:

I used tight shots often, especially in scenes where I was lighting the fake joint, to give the viewer a trapped, intimate view—as if they were inside my head, watching every thought unfold.
In contrast, when I did show a bit more space, it was still within a restricted, dark frame. This kept the feeling of tension, making the environment feel oppressive.
Conclusion: The mise-en-scène of my video wasn’t just visual—it was emotional. Every detail, from the lighter sparking flame, to the symbolic fake joint, to the heavy shadows, told the story of a character who was mentally spiraling. Inspired by the surreal, emotionally intense world of Travis Scott, I made sure that my mise-en-scène created not just a setting, but a feeling—one that sticks with the audience long after the video ends.
