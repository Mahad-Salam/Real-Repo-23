Genre Research:
Before I began the practical production of my music video, I immersed myself in researching the genre I was most drawn to—trap/psychedelic rap, heavily influenced by American hip-hop artists like Travis Scott. What initially attracted me to this genre was the deep emotional intensity combined with atmospheric, sometimes surreal visuals. It’s not just music—it’s a vibe, an experience. The genre allows for creativity that breaks traditional music video rules, and this freedom is exactly what I needed to express my own vision.

I began by analyzing key artists and their music videos, particularly focusing on Travis Scott, whose work has always fascinated me. His video for Highest in the Room became a central influence. I observed his use of lighting, color grading, camera movements, and how the visual aesthetics perfectly matched the psychological tone of the music. I also took note of the common genre conventions within psychedelic trap—slow motion shots, smoke effects, quick cuts, distorted realities, dreamlike sequences, and a certain emotional isolation that reflects inner turmoil or elevation.

My research included watching music videos on platforms like YouTube and studying academic articles and interviews about the evolution of hip-hop and trap music visuals. I also referenced videos by other artists like Don Toliver, Playboi Carti, and Kanye West to understand how visual storytelling differs within subgenres.

What stood out to me most was how this genre uses visual metaphor—things like floating in the air, falling, entering dark rooms, or being surrounded by surreal lights—to reflect psychological states like anxiety, euphoria, paranoia, or detachment. This deeply resonated with me because I’ve felt these emotions in my own life. That’s what pushed me toward making a video that wasn't just visually captivating, but also symbolically rich.

This research not only helped define my creative direction, but it also made me understand how important genre conventions are—not to follow them blindly, but to know how and when to break them to create something meaningful and original. It helped me plan scenes that would fit the genre but still carry my personal fingerprint.

Ultimately, genre research gave me a solid foundation. It showed me the possibilities of visual language within trap music videos and gave me the confidence to experiment with my own narrative, camera choices, and editing techniques, all while staying true to the energy and essence of the genre.
