Equipment:

1. Camera – iPhone 12 Pro Max
I shot the whole video using my phone’s camera. Phones today have surprisingly strong video capabilities, especially with features like 4K recording, cinematic mode, and stabilization. It also gave me flexibility—whether I was filming inside a tight car space or switching angles quickly, I didn’t need a massive rig or setup time.

The iPhone let me move easily, especially during POV and handheld shots.
The auto-focus and lighting adjustments helped a lot in the darker scenes.
I could review footage instantly, which helped with re-takes.
2. Tripod & DIY Mounts

I used a basic tripod for still shots, especially in the opening bedroom scene and the curtain shot at the end. For the car scenes, I made DIY mounts to hold the phone in place—one near the dashboard and another for the back seat when I wanted side angles.

The tripod kept the real-world shots stable and grounded.
DIY rigs made car shots possible without needing another person behind the camera.
3. Lighting

I mostly relied on natural light and practical lighting. I didn’t want things to look too artificial—especially because part of the concept was to keep reality and dream life slightly blurred. For a few dream sequences, I added small LED lights to play with colour hues (red/orange), and I used the car’s headlights and lighter flame as intentional light sources.

Used available streetlights and ambient light for car exteriors.
Lighter glow became a key visual tool in low-light scenes.
Curtains and sunlight played a role in the final scene for a natural shift back to reality.
4. Props as Functional Tools

Some of the props doubled as tools to influence lighting and atmosphere. For example:

The lighter became a mini light source in the smoking scene.
The phone screen added subtle glow inside the car.
Curtains in the final shot were used not just as a set detail, but as a way to shift lighting naturally in real-time.
5. Editing Software

All post-production was done on CapCut (mobile) and DaVinci Resolve (desktop). I used CapCut for quick cuts and rough edits on the go, and Resolve for final colour grading, effects (like the white memory flashes), and smoother transitions.

CapCut was good for syncing clips quickly to the beat of the music.
Resolve gave me more control over lighting tones and contrast during dream scenes.
I didn’t use big-budget equipment, but I didn’t need to. The gear I used was just enough to capture the vision, and in some ways, the limitations helped build the style—raw, grounded, and personal.
