Editing Process:

Editing was probably where the vision really came together. I had all the raw footage, but the real vibe of the video—switching between dream and reality, building tension, syncing to the music—that all happened in the editing stage. I used a mix of CapCut and DaVinci Resolve to get it done.

I started by building the basic timeline, laying out the scenes in the order they were supposed to appear. The intro came first—me sleeping in bed, slow mid-shots, very minimal movement. I deliberately left this part a bit longer and quieter, so when the dream started, it felt like a clear shift. I synced the dream entrance to a strong beat drop in the track, almost like it was a cue for the transition.

Once the dream kicks in, I tightened the pace. I used quicker cuts inside the car to show movement—cutting between me, my friend, the joint being lit, and the road. This section had to feel smooth but slightly off, so I used subtle slow motion on some shots to make it feel dreamlike, and used soft cross dissolves in a few places to show time kind of blending.

The body-in-the-trunk scene was tricky. I cut to it quickly, without warning, so it would feel jarring—almost like a memory or a glitch in the dream. Same with the POV kidnapping flashbacks. I threw in quick white flashes between those shots, fast cuts, and some blur overlays to make them feel more like mental intrusions than actual full scenes. I didn’t want to explain them too much—just enough for them to stick with the viewer.

The final section—the wake-up—slows the pacing again. I let the shots linger longer, to show the character is back in reality, but still mentally checked out. The opening of the curtains is where the whole video breathes again, both visually and rhythmically. The colour shifts from all those red/orange hues into brighter, washed-out natural light. No crazy transitions here, just a clean cut to end it.

Overall, editing was about making the visuals match the mental state of the character. Calm at first, then chaotic and warped, then still again—but never really peaceful. I didn’t want it to be overly flashy. The focus was on mood, flow, and making sure each section of the video felt like part of the same internal world.
