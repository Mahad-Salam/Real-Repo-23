Prop List:
Lighter – Used during the car scene while smoking. Small detail but adds realism and that laid-back, dreamlike feel.
Rolled joint (fake grass) – One of the main props in the dream. Helps sell the surreal, hazy vibe.
Car – Not just a vehicle, it’s basically the main set for the dream sequence. Central to the whole middle section.
Phone – Briefly used, adds realism to the car scenes.
Body in the trunk – Fully shown on screen. This is a major prop that shifts the tone—adds a dark, unexpected twist to the dream. It’s what pushes the surreal element from chill to unsettling.
Curtains – Used at the end when I wake up and open them. Symbolic, showing a shift from dream back to reality.
Bedding (pillow, blanket) – Used in both the opening and closing scenes. Ground the video in a domestic, real-world space.
Outfit (black dress shirt and pants) – Counts as a prop in this context because it visually separates the dream version of me from the real one.
Trunk (of the car) – Not usually seen as a prop, but it plays a key role in the scene where the body is revealed, so it deserves a mention.
